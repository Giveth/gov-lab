# gov-lab

A place for discussion, exploration, experimentation, iteration and implementation!

The goal of gov-lab is to research decentralized, distributed governance for community governance and organization - e.g. the central question:

*How can we improve collaboration on a shared goal as a community where the members are scattered around the globe*

Giveth is uniquely positioned for this research because the general attitude is one of constant curiosity and willingness to implement experiments. That means that we have a unique community that is ready to serve as guinea pigs for our experiments. As a result we can test assumptions about organizations easily and Giveth's *humans first* approach serves as a protection mechanism against unneccessary complication.

Publication of findings are in the works! Only two w00ks until completion! Meanwhile you can check out the Wiki of gov-lab repository and join building it through our Riot channels - look for `#giveth-governance:matrix.org` on [Riot.im](https://join.giveth.io)
