# The gov-lab game (most basic mechanics)

How to play:
* Click this [link](https://meet.jit.si/) and copy the generated URL (its usually to do with sentient animals)
* Head over to the [Governance Riot channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-governance:matrix.org), paste the link and an expected time limit that you can stick around for. Leave a window open for others to join you.
* Upon someone joining you, accept the interruption and decide on work to do together and **immediatly do it.**

* Review, adapt, iterate on the process.
