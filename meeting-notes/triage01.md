# gov-lab Triage 01 13.02.2019

## Tension 1

Need to relieve Griff of Community-Meeting host/facilitator role and step up the game of Gov Maintainer Roles people (Lorelei, Josh, Kay).

### Proposal
Formalize the action steps of the role that have to be carried out every week in order to have a **proper** community meeting with all cats herded.

### Action Steps
1 - Accept [gov-circle-maintainer (on line 36)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10yFmRviEoeUCg8GfWizHBtkFqU9kgm_OhmIj9Lt-ONU/edit#gid=2099154701) role for the week
2 - Appoint notetaker for next meeting
3 - Prepare meeting notes according to `governance-meeting-template.md`
4 - Announce meeting a few hours ahead of time, by describing:

    * exact time
    * loomio decisions for discussion
    * if a fireside chat is to be expected
    * meeting room in jit.si (usually https://meet.jit.si/giveth-gov)
    * don't forget to @room and the appointed notetaker
5 - Enter room ahead of time and check if streaming works, by starting it with youtube key
6 - Share notes link in Jitsi chat
7- Announce again who will facilitate the meeting, who will take minutes and who will take care of any follow-up
8 - Hold meeting
9 - Close meeting by appointing maintainer for following week

## Tension 2

Need to clear up roles around gov circle.

### Proposal
Merge the roles on rows 32 & 36 - *gov circle maintainer* & *governance decision documentation* and pass the role to the gov circle triad.

### New role accountabilities
Merge responsibilities of the roles and add responsibility for stream metadata edits:

- organize a weekly gov meeting (gov-lab host)
- write posts for our medium & wiki with guidance for future DACs
- Git hub Gov repo maintenance
- Make sure that notes are taken (a notetaker should be recruited before the meeting)
- Edit and Upload notes after community meeting
- Agreed proposals shall be added to approved policies on Wiki
- When stream is completed go to youtube and edit:
    * title of meeting
    * add to *community meetings playlist*
    * add youtube link to notes

## Tension 3

Wiki reorg left with unpolished nav

### Proposal
PR here: https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-wiki/pull/66

## Tension 4
There is a constant problem with using *hackmd.io* for notes and *Google Drive* for working spreadsheets in that no lists are kept to reference those (i.e. to find the *Roles Sheet* I rely on the autocomplete function of my browser, but there is no list of current working docs).

For *hackmd.io* notes this is usually resolved through accountabilities of gov-circle-maintainer who makes sure the notes get republished on the Wiki.

### Proposal
Maintain a list of working docs. Discussion: Where? And for a possible solution see Tension 4.

# Tension 4
We have a lack of threaded discussion technology to use for conversations that stretch over months. We are kinda using loomio for this, but because that is not the primary purpose of the platform, it does not work really well in that regard. Also we would benefit from "stickied-topics"

### Proposal
Run a self hosted discourse and establish real forum technology as a complement to our current toolset.
